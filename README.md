# 📌 speciesCoupledMatrixFoam Repository

# 🚀 Overview
The `speciesCoupledMatrixFoam` repository, developed by the team led by Ali Papi (Gabriel Marcos Magalhaes, Amir Jahanbakhsh and Mercedes M. Maroto-Valer), is a development to `coupledMatrixFoam` solver by Lange et al. (2025)(1). `coupledMatrixFoam` solves the pressure and phase fraction equations of multiphase fluid flows in porous media. This repository simulates species transport in porous media by assuming a binary system (CO2 and H2O).
The coupling of the new code with `coupledMatrixFoam` is as follows: initially, the pressure and phase fraction values of the phases are calculated using the fully coupled approach of the `coupledMatrixFoam` solver. Then, the calculated values of pressure and phase fractions are transferred to the species transport equations (two species per each phase: 4 equations in total) in the same timestep outside of the coupled loop. So, species transport equations are decoupled from pressure and phase fraction equations to reduce the size of the coupled matrix and decrease the memory overhead. 

🔬 This project is intended for researchers, engineers, and developers working on numerical modeling of multiphase flow in porous media using OpenFOAM. It is applicable in CO2 Storage, Oil&Gas Engineering, Environmental Engineering (Underground and Soil Contamination Modelling), and Geothermal Energies.

This solver has been developed based on OpenFOAM/foam-extend ecosystem and hence has compatibility with foam-extend (OpenFOAM) version 5.0.
